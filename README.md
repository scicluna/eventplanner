  # Event Planner

  ## Description

  I developed this event planner to fulfill the practical need of organizing my events. As my first React project, this app serves as a replacement for a weekly planner app I had created during the early months of my bootcamp experience. The event planner demonstrates my skills in animation and my ability to rapidly learn new technologies. Instead of building a full-stack application, I chose to store the state of events in local storage for a more streamlined approach.
